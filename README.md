## 1. Pulling and visualizing data


For any current date, the R script named **"Data_download.R"** is used to pull NEON measurements (NEE, LE, and soil moisture) and NOAA weather forecasts (NOAAâ€™s Global Ensemble Forecasting System, GEFS) across the four NEON sites, and to plot time series for the NEON history and the NOAA projections.

Before running, the variable **"base_dir"** at **Data_download.R** that defines the **working directory**, where the data are temporarily stored and output graphs saved, needs to be set manually. Additionally, the user should mannually create the directories on the local machine: the working directory, as well as "data", "graph", "drives" under the working directory. To schedule running the code on a daily basis, copy the following cron table in the Terminal and hit enter (`cron` is required, supported only on Unix-based operating systems): 


```


# [On terminal] crontab -e > i > Insert below code 

# setup the terrestral data script to run at 5:00 AM
MAILTO="kangjoon@bu.edu;barto22n@bu.edu;cjreimer@bu.edu;zpzuo@bu.edu"
00 05 * * * /usr/local/bin/Rscript/ "PATH/Data_download.R"


```


Of the data being pulled, the NEON measurements are updated monthly, with each update releasing new daily data for the past month. Therefore, for the daily runs, the plotted NEON historical time series will include data only up to the latest NEON release. For the NOAA weather forecasts, 35-day ensemble projections, making up of 31 ensembles, or forecasts by separate models, are released once per six hours at a 1-hour forecasting resolution.

The time series plots will be exported to the "graph" sub-directory under the main directory. 


## 2. Historical time-series fit


Before generating forecasts, use the R script named **"02_Historical Fitting.Rmd"** to fit the historical data. For this historical fit of NEE, LE, and soil moisture we created three random walk models. These models are Bayesian state-space models and include data model, process model and priors. The data model is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y[t]&space;\sim&space;N(x[t],&space;\tau_{obs})" title="y[t] \sim N(x[t], \tau_{obs})" /> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y[t]" title="y[t]" /> is determined by the latent variable (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x[t]" title="x[t]" />) and some observation error. The process model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x[t]&space;\sim&space;N(x[t-1],&space;\tau_{add})" title="x[t] \sim N(x[t-1], \tau_{add})" /> states that the following time point is the previous time point plus a Gaussian process error. Lastly, we define priors for the initial conditions, process error and observation error. The prior for the initial conditions is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x[1]&space;\sim&space;N(x_{ic},&space;\tau_{ic})" title="x[1] \sim N(x_{ic}, \tau_{ic})" /> which states that the initial conditions are pulled from a Gaussian distribution. The observation error and process error are both pulled from a gamma distribution, where the distribution parameters are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a_{obs}" title="a_{obs}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_{obs}" title="r_{obs}" /> for the observation error and $a_{add}$ and $r_{add}$ for the process error.
